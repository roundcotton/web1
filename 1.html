<p>Hi? <strong>I am very very hungry.</strong> let me know <u>your favorite or amazing tasty food.</u><br>
  I like bread,chocolate,pizza,hamburger,meat,cheese and so on. so low calorie food is so light to me and less tasty. ( exceptively, when I am hungry, it feels like tasty. I'm sure you're just like me....♡) </p>
<p>
I tell you about my taste. maybe you are not interesting. but like it or not, I have to tell you.<br>
because I need a paragraph. I am studying <a href="https://opentutorials.org/course/3084/18453" title="생활코딩 츄라이" target="_blank">생활코딩</a> HTML course now. what? don't you know this? why? why don't you know? try it. it's very helpful.<br>
anyway if you recommend rich flavor food like a cheese hamburger <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PoglyASMR" title="알려주러가기" target="_blank">to me</a>, I will be happy.
</p>
